Project Report on Energy Consumption Bot 
1. Introduction 
The world today faces a pressing challenge in terms of energy eAiciency and sustainable 
usage of resources. With increasing demands for electricity and other energy sources, it 
becomes crucial to adopt methods that not only reduce wastage but also ensure long-term 
sustainability. While awareness campaigns exist, people often lack real-time personalized 
guidance on how they can reduce energy consumption in their daily lives. 
To address this issue, the Energy Consumption Bot has been developed. It is a web-based 
chatbot system designed to analyze user queries, provide suggestions for eAicient energy 
usage, and recommend practical solutions for reducing unnecessary energy expenditure. 
The bot leverages modern web technologies, including JavaScript, APIs, and interactive UI 
features like theme customization, to provide a rich and engaging user experience. 
This project is not only a demonstration of programming and UI/UX skills but also a step 
towards promoting sustainable living by making people more conscious of their energy 
usage. 
2. Objectives 
The main objectives of the Energy Consumption Bot are: 
 To provide real-time energy-saving suggestions based on user queries. 
 To create an interactive chatbot interface that makes energy conservation tips easy 
to access. 
 To promote sustainable energy usage by educating users about alternatives. 
 To incorporate modern design features such as theme switching for a better user 
experience. 
 To utilize APIs for dynamic and updated information, such as energy-saving news or 
smart device recommendations. 
 To build the system primarily with JavaScript and complementary web 
technologies, ensuring responsiveness and interactivity. 
3. Features and Modules 
The Energy Consumption Bot consists of several features that make it both informative and 
user-friendly. 
3.1 Chatbot for Energy Suggestions 
 Provides instant tips on energy-eAicient practices. 
 Responds to queries like “How to reduce electricity usage in summer?” or “What is 
the best way to save energy while cooking?” 
 OAers personalized recommendations (e.g., suggesting LED bulbs instead of 
incandescent lights, using smart plugs, or optimizing AC usage). 
3.2 Theme Changing Feature 
 Allows users to switch between light mode, dark mode, and other themes. 
 Improves accessibility and provides a personalized interface. 
 Saves user preferences locally (using local storage). 
3.3 Integration of APIs 
 External APIs are used to fetch real-time information like the latest energy-saving 
products, renewable energy statistics, or environmental news. 
 Dynamic updates ensure that the bot’s suggestions remain relevant. 
3.4 Energy Saving Categories 
The bot categorizes suggestions into multiple domains such as: 
 Home Energy EAiciency (appliances, lighting, heating/cooling). 
 Transportation EAiciency (carpooling, EVs, public transport). 
 OAice/Workplace Energy Saving (smart power strips, reducing idle PC usage). 
 Renewable Alternatives (solar panels, smart meters). 
3.5 User Interaction History 
 Keeps a session-based history of interactions for better tracking. 
 Allows users to revisit past suggestions without repeating queries. 
3.6 Additional Features 
 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop. 
 Voice Input (Optional): Can accept voice commands for accessibility. 
 Notifications: Provides daily or weekly energy-saving tips. 
4. System Design and Architecture 
The Energy Consumption Bot is designed as a client-side focused application with minimal 
backend dependency. Its architecture ensures responsiveness and adaptability. 
 Frontend: 
Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot interface is interactive and 
styled for user-friendliness. 
 Backend (Optional): 
A lightweight backend using Node.js/Express can handle API calls, log user queries, 
or provide custom responses. 
 APIs: 
Integrated APIs provide external data, such as renewable energy sources, weather 
data (to suggest energy adjustments based on climate), and product 
recommendations. 
 Database (Optional): 
If extended, a database like MongoDB/MySQL can be used to store user profiles, 
preferences, and long-term history. 
 Architecture Workflow: 
1. User interacts with the chatbot by typing or speaking a query. 
2. The frontend processes input using JavaScript logic. 
3. If needed, APIs are called to fetch external data. 
4. Bot provides a response with actionable energy-saving tips. 
5. Session history is updated, and UI adapts to user preferences (like theme). 
5. Technologies Used 
 Programming Language: JavaScript (core of chatbot logic). 
 Frontend Tools: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive design). 
 APIs: REST APIs for fetching energy-related data. 
 Optional Backend: Node.js with Express.js (for dynamic responses). 
 Database (Optional): MongoDB/MySQL (if persistence is required). 
 Version Control: Git/GitHub for project management. 
6. Working/Implementation 
1. User Interaction: 
o User types a query into the chatbot interface. 
o JavaScript event listeners capture the input. 
2. Bot Processing: 
o The bot parses keywords like “electricity,” “AC,” “transport,” etc. 
o If query matches pre-programmed suggestions, bot responds instantly. 
3. API Requests: 
o For advanced queries, APIs fetch real-time energy-saving articles or device 
recommendations. 
o Example: If a user asks, “What is the latest energy-eAicient air 
conditioner?” the bot fetches relevant API data. 
4. Theme Customization: 
o Users toggle between light/dark modes. 
o JavaScript updates CSS dynamically and stores preferences. 
5. Response Display: 
o Responses are displayed in a chat bubble style. 
o Bot can also provide lists, links, or images for better understanding. 
6. History Tracking: 
o Suggestions are stored during the session. 
o Users can scroll back to previous tips. 
7. Advantages and Use Cases 
Advantages 
 Practical Guidance: Users get real and actionable tips. 
 Personalization: Theme and query-based customization enhance user engagement. 
 Awareness: Promotes sustainable living habits. 
 Accessibility: Can be used by anyone without technical knowledge. 
 Scalability: More categories and API integrations can be added. 
Use Cases 
 Households: Learning how to reduce monthly electricity bills. 
 Students: Awareness about energy-eAicient habits for hostels or dorms.
